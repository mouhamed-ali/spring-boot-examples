# Project Title

Avoid SSL validation in Java

## Overview

In this example, we will configure our jvm to avoid any ssl verification.
The JVM contains a default Trust Store that contains standard well-known certificates. So in this example we will use a fake trust store
that accepts any certificate without any verification.

### Prerequisites

Java 8 or above

### Building

After cloning the project, you can build it from source with this command:

```
mvn clean package
```

### Running the application

you can run this application using java -jar, as shown in the following example:

```
java -jar target/1-jvm-by-pass-ssl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

or using the spring boot maven plugin :

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Built With

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) v3.6.0 - Dependency Management


### Running the tests

There is no junit tests in this example. We've created our test in the runner package. We've implemented the Spring’s CommandLineRunner interface
 so after you start the application the test will be executed automatically and you can check the logs after.
